# coronavirus-simulation
Coronavirus simulation is a decision support interactive tool. This solution developed during Hackorona's hackaton.

When we face a pandemic and a virus is spreading at a very fast rate, it is very challenging to make a decision and choose the most effective policies that will contain the virus outbreak, i.e. the policies with minimal economic, political and social impacts.

Our tool helps to analyze the spread with an interactive simulation.
